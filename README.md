**EHRInsight: AI-Powered Sepsis Prediction and Care Planning**  
*Transforming Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into actionable insights with AI*

EHRInsight is an innovative AI tool designed to predict sepsis risk and generate personalized care plans from EHR data. Built using PyTorch and deployed with Streamlit, it combines multi-modal deep learning (LSTM + text features) with explainability (SHAP) to empower healthcare decision-making. Trained on the MIMIC-III dataset, this project showcases end-to-end AI engineering—from data preprocessing to cloud deployment.

**Key Features**:  
- Predicts sepsis probability from vital signs and clinical notes.  
- Generates actionable care plans based on clinical guidelines.  
- Provides interpretable insights with SHAP visualizations.  
- Interactive UI hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud: [Try it live!](https://ehrinsight.streamlit.app)  

**Tech Stack**:  
- Python, PyTorch, Pandas, SHAP  
- Streamlit for web deployment  
- MIMIC-III dataset  

**Why It Matters**:  
Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital mortality, and early detection saves lives. EHRInsight demonstrates how AI can bridge data and clinical action, reflecting my passion for healthcare innovation as an AI engineer.

**Get Started**:  
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/senthilcaesar/ehrinsight.git`  
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Run: `streamlit run app.py`
